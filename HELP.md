# HELP

It's ok to consult different resources to complete this challenge. You wouldn't be alone as part of our team, so it's only fair :).

If you're new to Ruby and Ruby on Rails, the [Getting started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) may help, especially the section on [CRUD](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#crudit-where-crudit-is-due). It's a guide to getting up and running with Rails - the general layout of an application as well as the basic principles of MVC and REST-ful design.

If you need help writing tests, the [Testing Rails Applications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) may help, in addition to the documentation for [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot), which helps create test fixtures, and [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker), which helps generate fake data.
